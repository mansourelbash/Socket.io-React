# Socket.IO with Node.js, Express, and React

A comprehensive guide and implementation of Socket.IO with Node.js, Express, and React. This project demonstrates real-time communication between a Node.js server using Express and a React client.

## Overview

This project showcases the integration of Socket.IO for enabling real-time bidirectional event-based communication. The server, built with Node.js and Express, hosts the WebSocket server using Socket.IO, enabling seamless communication with the React client.

## Features

- Real-time communication between server and client.
- Express server setup with Socket.IO integration.
- React client interacting with the WebSocket server.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    cd your_repository
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    cd server
    npm install

    # Install client dependencies
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

    The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Start the client:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

    The React application will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

### Testing

This project includes tests for both the server and client. To run tests:

- Server tests: Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm test`.
- Client tests: Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm test`.
